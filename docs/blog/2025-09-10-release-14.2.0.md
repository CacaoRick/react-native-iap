React Native IAP 14.2.0 focuses on stability and smoother integration across iOS and Android.

## Highlights

- iOS: Idempotent, non-blocking `initConnection()` with proper failure propagation. Prevents false-positive connected states under rapid navigation.
- iOS: Upgraded OpenIAP to `~> 1.1.8` for StoreKit 2 stability.
- Android: Ship consumer R8 keep rules so Nitro `HybridObjects` arenâ€™t stripped in release builds. Apps no longer need manual keeps.
- CI: Use vendored Yarn binary to avoid Corepack network/503 issues.
- Examples: Stabilized Subscription/Purchase flows and improved tests.

## Details

- `ios/HybridRnIap.swift`: `initConnection()` now awaits OpenIAP initialization and returns the actual result. Errors surface through the purchase error channel with `E_INIT_CONNECTION` and the hook no longer marks as connected prematurely.
- `NitroIap.podspec`: Depends on `openiap` `~> 1.1.8`.
- `android/consumer-rules.pro`: Keep rules for Nitro IAP classes; wired via `consumerProguardFiles` so downstream apps inherit them automatically.
- CI workflows updated to call `.yarn/releases/yarn-3.6.1.cjs` directly.

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking API changes. After upgrading:

1. Reinstall Pods for the iOS example/app

   ```bash
   cd example/ios && pod install
   ```

2. Regenerate Nitrogen if you edited specs

   ```bash
   yarn nitrogen
   ```

3. Android consumers can remove any app-local keep rules previously added for Nitro IAP (the library now ships consumer rules).
