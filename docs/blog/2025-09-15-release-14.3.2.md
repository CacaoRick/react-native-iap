## Changed

Small patch focusing on Nitro init robustness and the optional Expo iOS Folly workaround.

- Fix: Guard HybridObject creation and drop `isRuntimeAlive` usage to prevent CI/Jest issues.
- Plugin: Re‑add opt‑in `"with-folly-no-couroutines": true` to inject Folly defines in the Podfile.
- Docs: Restore installation note and remove a local Docusaurus type shim to avoid duplicate identifiers.

No breaking changes.
