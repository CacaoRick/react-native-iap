## Changed

Patch polish for the 14.3 line: better guard rails around purchase requests and cleaner error mapping.

- JS: Treat `requestPurchase`/`requestSubscription` separately, warn in development when the wrong payload is supplied, and drop the legacy `request` fallback.
- JS: Normalize native error codes (including the Android "canceled" spelling) and keep init connection failures suppressed until the store is ready.
- Bridge: Warn when the iOS product type is unrecognized and align Active Subscription expiration fields with the generated schema.
- GraphQL: Bump to [openiap-gql 1.0.0](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-gql/releases/tag/1.0.0) so the generated schema stays in sync with the published contract.

No breaking changes.
