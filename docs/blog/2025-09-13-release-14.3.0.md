Short, focused release centered on Android init behavior and two new JS helpers.

## Added

- `getStorefront()`: returns the current storefront country code.
- `deepLinkToSubscriptions()`: opens the native subscription management UI (Android/iOS).

## Changed

- Android: migrate to OpenIAP Google 1.1.0; align init and field mapping with spec.

## Fixed

- Android: address a potential `init` race and improve error propagation.
- iOS: add temporary stubs to keep Nitro/iOS aligned with the JS spec.
