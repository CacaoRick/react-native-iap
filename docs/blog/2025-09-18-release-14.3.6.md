## Breaking(minor) ⚡️

`useIAP` now expects callers to lean on the supplied callbacks instead of the temporary `currentPurchase` helpers.

<!-- truncate -->

import AdFitTopFixed from "@site/src/uis/AdFitTopFixed";

<AdFitTopFixed />

## What changed

- Removed the `currentPurchase` / `currentPurchaseError` state from `useIAP` and route purchase outcomes through `onPurchaseSuccess` / `onPurchaseError`.
- Trimmed the duplicate-event guard and logs so the hook focuses on forwarding results and refreshing subscription snapshots.

We realize this is a slight breaking tweak for hook consumers, but the root API stays intact and the behavior is now clearer. Thanks for understanding as we ship it as 3.0.6.
