Small Android-centric polish with dependency bumps to keep the store bridges aligned.

- Upgrade the fallback/config plugin to [openiap-google 1.1.10](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-google/releases/tag/1.1.10) so Android builds pick up the latest Billing configuration fixes.
- Bump the iOS pod to [openiap 1.1.12](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-apple/releases/tag/1.1.12) and switch native error codes to PascalCase to match the shared TypeScript surface.
- Restore the explicit `Failed to initialize connection` message when Play Billing rejects `initConnection()` so logs stay actionable.
- Keep receipt validation failures tagged with a helpful prefix even when the underlying exception omits a message.
- Drop the purchase token from acknowledge/consume error payloads to avoid leaking identifiers in client logs.

No breaking changes.
